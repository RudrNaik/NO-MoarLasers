# Moar Lasers

Are you tired of your ifrit, revoker, and vortex all being unable to lase more than one target at a time? I sure am. It's annoying that rocket pods on those jets are frankly a bit more than useless. So thats why this mod exists. It gives you more lases. You can jack it up, you can jack it down to normal, its your preference.

The config file has 2 major things you can change. 

> **Increased_Targets** | Determines the amount *more* of targets you can lase at a time. This is added onto the base amount. IE: If you set it to 3, planes like the bralwer can now lase 6 targets total.

> **Strict_Mode** | This is tied to a multiplayer blocker thats built in and built off of the one that Nikkorap developed. When you set it to **false**- it allows you to play with the mod active while solo, but when you join a lobby or host- it will disable. When set to **true** you no longer can join games in the server browser, but can host a game with the mod active.

# Known Issues
- I have not done a lot of testing for multiplayer- as such it may be finnicky with the Strict_Mode settings. I suggest leaving it at false.
- This is my first mod ever, there is *probably* something thats gonna be broken. As such, DM me on discord (@Spinypine) with what's going on and ill investigate.
