# Moar Lasers

Are you tired of your Ifrit, Revoker, and Vortex all being unable to lase more than one target at a time? I sure am. It's annoying that rocket pods on those jets are completely outshadowed by AGMs, so thats why this mod exists. It changes the amount of targets that an aircraft can laser designate at once. For example, a cricket can lase 2 targets in the base game. With the basic configuration- Moar Lasers allows you to laser designate 5 targets. You can change this value via the config variables listed below.

> **Increased_Targets** | Determines the amount *more* of targets you can lase at a time. This is added onto the base amount. IE: If you set it to 3, planes like the bralwer can now lase 6 targets total.

> **MpMode** | This is tied to a multiplayer blocker thats built in. When you set it to **MpDisabled**- it allows you to play with the mod active while solo, but when you join a lobby or host with others- it will disable. However- when set to **RestrictedMM** you no longer can join games in the server browser, but can host a game with the mod active at the caveat that whomeever else wants to join **needs** to have the mod installed as well.
